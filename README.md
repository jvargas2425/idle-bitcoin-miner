# idle-bitcoin-miner

Welcome to my first JavaScript project! This is a project I am working on to combine all of the material that was covered in a JavaScript course that I have recently completed. My goal was to create an idle game with Bitcoin Mining as the theme, coded with JavaScript and Jquery. This is not the final complete version of the game and many features and codes will be added as I perfect my skill as a coder and developer. At the moment I do not plan to host the game on a server as this is just a project to show case the skills I have learned as a coder.

Planned game features:
- Achievements
- Vanity Items available for sale. That makes the game more enjoyable and solves the issue where the game gets boring because of infinite money.
- Items for purchase that will boost the output rate of mining equipment
- I would like to do some research on balancing the game, specifically the rate of output for each mining equipment to make sure none of them output too much or too little.

Planned visual features:
- I really want to work on perfecting my skills as a web developer and want to pretty up the website by learning CSS.
- One of the first things I want to do with the page is create a fixed header for the game's title and Bitcoin Balance section.
- I want to work with CSS to optimize the layout of the page and actually create a great layout for the page and game.

Back-end features:
- I want to learn to work with databases and servers to be able to offer a game feature where players can save their game progress.
- As I perfect my skills as coder, I will always be updating the Back End features of the game to better optimize the game.
